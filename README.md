# 🏪 Sneakers Store  

Sneakers Store is a modern online shop built with **Next.js**, **React**, **TailwindCSS**, and **Redux Toolkit**.  
It provides a clean and responsive interface to browse, add to cart, and purchase trendy sneakers.  

👉 The products are not fetched from an external database but come from a local file (`src/data/product.js`) containing a predefined list of items.  
This makes it easy to test and customize the store without any backend configuration.
